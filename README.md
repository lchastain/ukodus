ukodus
======

A graphical sudoku assistant / solver

(still under development; usable, but not quite ready for prime-time)
This is an end-user application; not much in the way of reusable api.

For best docs, see the 'help' (ukodus.chm) file.
Aside from the compiled help file, should be cross-platform.  For an
alternative to that, will generate some html pages and show them in a browser,
in a future rev.

===========================================================================
'Naming' is often cited as 'The Greatest Challenge in Software Development'.

Why is the matrix class called 'laffingas' ?
    It is an abbreviation by way of an intentional misspelling of 'Laughing Gas',
    which is the layman's term for 'Nitrous Oxide' which can be properly abbreviated
    as 'NO' which is also the word 'no', that when translated to German is
    'nein', which sounds a lot like the English word for the numeric value 'nine',
    which is the number of rows and columns in a standard sudoku puzzle, and you
    gotta admit - this chain of 'logic' is kind of funny.
