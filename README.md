A graphical sudoku assistant / solver

(still under development; usable, but not quite ready for prime-time)

'Naming' is often cited as 'The Greatest Challenge in Software Development'.

Why is the matrix class called 'laffingas' ?
    It is an abbreviation by way of an intentional misspelling of 'Laughing Gas',
    which is the layman's term for 'Nitrous Oxide' which can be properly abbreviated
    as 'NO' which is also the word 'no', that when translated to German is
    'nein', which sounds a lot like the English word for the numeric value 'nine',
    which is the number of rows and columns in a standard sudoku puzzle.
