A graphical sudoku assistant / solver

Why is the application called 'laffingas' ?
    It is an abbreviation by way of an intentional misspelling of 'Laughing Gas',
    which is the layman's term for 'Nitrous Oxide' which can be properly abbreviated
    as 'NO' which is also the word 'no', which in German is pronounced
    'nein', which sounds a lot like the English word for the numeric value 'nine',
    which is the 'prime' number in sudoku.
