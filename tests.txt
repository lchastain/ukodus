Visual / integration tests; not sure how to automate or code into a unit test:

Startup screen has 4 buttons in a vertical column
Startup screen has menubar with main items:  File, View, Help (right justified).
Solution phase should not have a 'Save' button.
Save of a loaded file should suggest filename; otherwise, empty.
When user supplies a save name, the title changes if successful save.

After a (partial) solution is Reset - should go back to the end of the puzzle
    definition phase.  No tooltips, all values mouse-clickable into any square,
    black color values, the 'Save' button is present, and 'Start' will move you
    into the solution phase, as it normally does.
