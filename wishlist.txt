This is an ongoing wish list.
Items are moved to the 'DEVELOP.LOG' after they are either implemented or addressed
  as being no longer desired.

isAreaXreducible and stripX - very similar - consider combining.
Probably same is true of the 'Naked' methods.  Have now done just
that, with the Swordfish.

a Deployment / installation mechanism

Make the help info - cross-platform
    Tried to generate - many images missing?  And others not formatted well.

Need a menu-based 'update', to adjust tool-tips to account for user-entered values
when they do not want to press 'Next'.

Make the 'Explanation' menu item (enabled along with remove highlight) work, to give the same
basic info that goes to the System.out ?  Better format, of course.
Develop and show explanations of pending reductions -
          X-wing, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair (all, actually)

Keyboard entry for puzzle definition.  Need key listener,
      also a way to indicate which is active,
    and a way to move to another square.

Recognize when the reductions have removed all possibilities -
   show an invalid puzzle and stop, as opposed to 'cannot find...'.

Add key listener to the method reorder.  Can handle arrows
and upper/lower case chars; the one to move will need a highlight of some kind,
and a key sequence to move the highlight, vs the highlighted item.  Low priority,
but may be easy if we go ahead and add key listener to the puzzle def phase.
